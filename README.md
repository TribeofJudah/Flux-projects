# Flux-projects
Purposed for documenting my understanding of PCB design, Schematic design and Simulation. 

Flux is a browser-based end-to-end electronic design tool (EDA). I chose to explore this tool due to it's collobaration features, allowing mulitple members of the team to colloborate in real time.
